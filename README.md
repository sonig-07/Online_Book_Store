# 📚 Online_Book_Store

This project is a small bookstore website built using PHP for the page structure, SCSS/CSS for styling, and JavaScript for basic interactions. It’s a simple front-end driven setup that can run on any normal local server like XAMPP or WAMP. The idea is to provide a clean layout that can later be connected to a database or full backend if needed.

## What’s Inside

* PHP pages (home, product list, book details)
* SCSS files along with compiled CSS
* Vanilla JS for simple UI actions
* Admin section with its own pages
* Fonts, icons, images, and UI assets
* Optional SQL file with basic table structures
